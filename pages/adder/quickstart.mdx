About [Adder](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/adder).
Adder is a tool for tailing the Cardano blockchain and emitting events for each block and transaction seen, based on user configurable filters. 
These events can be processed in other event-based toolchains to produce rich and reactive applications for Cardano.
